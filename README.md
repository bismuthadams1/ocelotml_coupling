# OCELOTML COUPLING
This repository contains the code to download the OCELOT dimer v1 dataset and use the pretrained models to make predictions of intermolecular electronic coupling. You can find the online implementation at [here](https://oscar.as.uky.edu/ocelotml_coupling)


## Files and folders
`models` - contains pretrained models for HOMO-HOMO (hh.pt) and LUMO-LUMO (ll.pt) coupling

`eval.ipynb` - make predictions with XYZ file with dimer coordinates

`dataset` - You can download the OCELOT dimer v1 dataset from https://oscar.as.uky.edu/datasets/#4

`test.xyz` - contains XYZ coordinates for a pentacene dimer
